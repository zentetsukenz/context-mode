# context-mode — MANDATORY routing rules

You have context-mode MCP tools available. These rules are NOT optional — they protect your context window from flooding. A single unrouted command can dump 56 KB into context and waste the entire session. Zed does NOT have hooks, so these instructions are your ONLY enforcement mechanism. Follow them strictly.

## BLOCKED commands — do NOT use these

### curl / wget — FORBIDDEN
Do NOT use `curl` or `wget` in any shell command. They dump raw HTTP responses directly into your context window.
Instead use:
- `mcp:context-mode:ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` to fetch and index web pages
- `mcp:context-mode:ctx_execute(language: "javascript", code: "const r = await fetch(...)")` to run HTTP calls in sandbox

### Inline HTTP — FORBIDDEN
Do NOT run inline HTTP calls via `node -e "fetch(..."`, `python -c "requests.get(..."`, or similar patterns. They bypass the sandbox and flood context.
Instead use:
- `mcp:context-mode:ctx_execute(language, code)` to run HTTP calls in sandbox — only stdout enters context

### Direct web fetching — FORBIDDEN
Do NOT use any direct URL fetching tool. Raw HTML can exceed 100 KB.
Instead use:
- `mcp:context-mode:ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `mcp:context-mode:ctx_search(queries)` to query the indexed content

## REDIRECTED tools — use sandbox equivalents

### Shell (>20 lines output)
Shell is ONLY for: `git`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cd`, `ls`, `npm install`, `pip install`, and other short-output commands.
For everything else, use:
- `mcp:context-mode:ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` — run multiple commands + search in ONE call
- `mcp:context-mode:ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "...")` — run in sandbox, only stdout enters context

### File reading (for analysis)
If you are reading a file to **edit** it → reading is correct (edit needs content in context).
If you are reading to **analyze, explore, or summarize** → use `mcp:context-mode:ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` instead. Only your printed summary enters context. The raw file stays in the sandbox.

### grep / search (large results)
Search results can flood context. Use `mcp:context-mode:ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "grep ...")` to run searches in sandbox. Only your printed summary enters context.

## Tool selection hierarchy

1. **GATHER**: `mcp:context-mode:ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` — Primary tool. Runs all commands, auto-indexes output, returns search results. ONE call replaces 30+ individual calls.
2. **FOLLOW-UP**: `mcp:context-mode:ctx_search(queries: ["q1", "q2", ...])` — Query indexed content. Pass ALL questions as array in ONE call.
3. **PROCESSING**: `mcp:context-mode:ctx_execute(language, code)` | `mcp:context-mode:ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` — Sandbox execution. Only stdout enters context.
4. **WEB**: `mcp:context-mode:ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `mcp:context-mode:ctx_search(queries)` — Fetch, chunk, index, query. Raw HTML never enters context.
5. **INDEX**: `mcp:context-mode:ctx_index(content, source)` — Store content in FTS5 knowledge base for later search.

## Output constraints

- Keep responses under 500 words.
- Write artifacts (code, configs, PRDs) to FILES — never return them as inline text. Return only: file path + 1-line description.
- When indexing content, use descriptive source labels so others can `search(source: "label")` later.

## ctx commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `ctx stats` | Call the `stats` MCP tool and display the full output verbatim |
| `ctx doctor` | Call the `doctor` MCP tool, run the returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx upgrade` | Call the `upgrade` MCP tool, run the returned shell command, display as checklist |
